# Tic_Tac_Toe
Objective: To be the first to make a straight line with either ‘X’ or ‘O’.
Game Board: The board consists of a 3×3 matrix-like structure, having 9 small boxes.
The computer: Since it is a two-player game each player gets one chance alternatively. i.e.; first player1 than player2.
Moves: The computer starts the game with O. After that player makes moves alternatively.
Winning: You win by making your symbol in a row or diagonal or column. Also, as a part of strategy you need to block your opponent from forming a straight line while making of your own.
